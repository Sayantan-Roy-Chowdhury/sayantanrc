chern classes - Poincare duality - obstruction theory - obstruction to find k independant sections -  link with curvature - integration of chern class=intersection points 
Can higher chern classes be related to higher intersections???

modules- vector bundles of varying dimensions
tensor product - product of two vector bundles
that is fibre is the product of each fibre - for example if the fibre is 0in one case,then the product fibre is 0.
flat modules - 
captures if there are sections that becomes 0 in the product 
non torsion free modules - this contains non zero sections that are zero in an open neighbourhood - eg
example R/I - this conatins 1 point and 0 evrywhere else- so leads to vanishing sections
torsion free  example being (x,y) in k(x,y) ) 
if suddenly dimension increases at one point , then it is 0 everywhere else- Is this true??


Sheaf cohomology - atleast over modules- obstruction to find k independent class - example of a C[z](M_{1}) and C[z^{-1}](M_{2}) module whose intersection is a C[z,z^{-1}](M_{12}) module is a sheaf on P1.
elements of first cohomology = elements of M_{12} that does not come from M_{1} and M_{2}
Example (M_{1},M_{12} is same, M_{2} = z^{i}C[z^{-i}] = O(i) bundle
dim(H^{0}) = i+1 i \geq 0 , 0 o.w. 
dim(H^{1}) = -i-1 i<0 , 0 o.w.

winding no of a singular point = how many times the direction of vf turns around if we follow a small loop= look at the map p:S^{1} \to S^{1}. (1st S^{1} is loop around singularity - 2nd S^{1} is the set of all vector directions of the plane(surprisingly similar to the gauss map)- deg of the map
generalization = deg of map p : X \to S^{n} : f(x) - z / |f(x) - z |



Guillemin-Pollack
f:X to Y . Z submani of Y
Transversality - Im(df_{x}) + T_{y}Z = T_{y}Y
intersection no of f(X) and Z = I(f,Z)

Some important theorems::::
If smooth functions g1,g2..gl are independent at each point where they all vanish, then the set of zeroes Z is a submanifold of X with codim l 
Partial Converse 1 :: If y is a regular value. f^{-1}(y) can be cut out by independant fucntions
Partial Converse 2 :: Every submanifold Z of Y is locally cut out by independant fucntions

We can consider X has a boundary bdX, Y and Z are boundaryless, transversality = f and bd(f) = f|(bdX) is transversal to Z - f^{-1}(z) = submani with boundary- homotopic transversal maps have same intersections- so if a map f from boundary can be extended to whole manifolds then I(f,Z) = 0 - deg(f) = I(f, {y})

f: bd(D) to R^{n} , F : D to R^{n}, f doesnot touch z, then
F^{-1}(z) = W(f,z)
\int f^{*} w =  deg(f) \int w
(something to do with c_{1}(det E) = c_{1}(E) = deg(E) since generally det(df) finds its way here. So, how similar is this to the Gauss map idea? since there also we see the det(df) ???????

Gauss Bonnet(even dimensional hypersurface. 
\int curvature = deg(gauss) = euler characteristic / 2.


Lef map : f : M \to M such that graph(f) intersects diagonal transversely in M X M (all maps are homotopic to Lef)
This happens only when graph(df_{x}) doesnot intersect T_{x}(diagonal) = df_{x} doesnt have 1 as eigenvalue = det(df_{x} - I) != 0 .  
L(f) = no of fixed points of f with multiplicities = intersection points
If f is homotopic to identity , then L(f) = euler characteristic
L(f) = \sum_{f(x) =x} L_{x}(f)
L_{x}(f)
 = +1 (df_{x} - 1 preserve orientation)
 = -1( ,, reverse orientation)
 
if x is an isolated fixed point, consider B containing x
then define L_{x}(f)= deg(F) where F = f(z) - z / |f(z) - z | on bd(B) . this equals the earlier L_{x}(f) if x is a lef point.


Poincare Hopf 
intersection of v.f. with 0 section 
flow with those vector fields - map is homotopic to identity - fixed points = singularities of vector fields with index same as the Lef map



















Poincaré defined the nth-Betti number as the maximal number of n-dimensional cycles that do not form the
boundary of an n + 1-dimensional submanifold.

h-Cobordism, Morse theory
From the vector field ∇f one can construct a complex. The i-degree component is the
vector space spanned by the singularities with Morse index i and the differential d maps
each singularity with Morse index i to a sum of all the index i − 1 singularities that can be
reached by an integral curve of the vector field. Multiple connecting paths contribute each
with a sign. One of the main results in this revisited version of Morse theory is that the
homology of this complex equals the simplicial homology of the space. This result tells us
that the number of critical points of f must be at least equal to the sum of all Betti numbers,
otherwise the complex could not have the required homology. Likewise we have a lower
bound on the number of singularities in the vector field ∇f and the number of fixpoints of
the map exp(t∇f ) : M → M.


2 ref - Morse theory for lagrangian intersections , Proof of arnold conjecture for surfaces - floer
Brower degree = (-1)^{Morse degree}
Physical interpretation = singular = equilibrium - morse index = how stable? - links with symplectic - energy(hamiltonian) - f = turned intoa Hamiltonian by adding a kinetic energy term - project onto grad (f) hence describes physical models of Morse theory- M into T^{*}M is the maximal subspace where symplectic form w vanishes (Lagrangian subspaces)-fixed points of Hamiltonian v.f. = intersections of Lagrangian spaces ( similar to fixed point theory and intersection of vector field with 0 section kind of idea
) - If we look at the flowed version of the \phi_{t}(M) ⊂ T^{*}M we see that it intersects M at the points where f is singular, so the Morse complex of (M, f ) is spanned by the intersection points of \phi_{t}(M) and M and the connecting paths swipe out strips with boundaries on the two submanifolds - complex for any pair of Lagrangian
submanifolds that intersect normally -  Floer needed a (almost)-complex structure on M to define his strips as (pseudo)-holomorphic disks, but ultimately the homology of
his complex only depended on the symplectic topology of the space and the Lagrangian submanifolds - Moreover the homology did not change under Hamiltion flows of the La-
grangian submanifolds, so it only depended on the Hamiltonian isotopy classes of the submanifolds - gets linked with fixed point theory(any Hamiltonian map of a
manifold M onto itself has at least as many fixed points as the sum of the Betti numbers of M.)

A New beginning(1 ref - A mini-course on topological strings by Marcel Vonk)
superstring - A manifold has lot of structure (Calabi Yau, symplectic, complex)
A-model(symplectic structure) - forget the other structure.
B-model(complex structure)
calculations in A model M = calculations in B model M'(mirror manifold since Hodge numbers reversed)

these ideas led to conjecture a formula that counted the number of curves of any degree in the quintic threefold.

Mirror symmetry (Homological algebra of mirror symmetry)
For each pair of Lagrangian submanifolds in M there should exist a pair of
0sheaves on the mirror M' such that the Floer homology of the Lagrangians is isomorphic
to the sheaf homology between the two sheaves - actually complexes of Lagrangian and sheaves.

Derived Category
Let A be an abelian category
Let K be the category of chain complexes with objects in A upto chain homotopy of complexes
If you invert the quasimorphisms(with ideas from localization). this becomes the derived category.
Important results : 1)quasimorphisms between complexes of injective objects are homotopy equivalence.
2) we can get injective resolutions in case it is a bounded category











Obstruction theory
Let E be a n-vector bundle, k sections exist over m-skeleton, does it extend to the m+1 skeleton??
take a m-cell, we have k sections on the boundary i.e. we have a map
S^{m-1} \to V(k,n) [pulling back E to be a trivial bundle. So we get an element of $\pi_{m-1}(V(k,n))$ which is the obstruction: if this goes to 0, the k section extends, hence we get a  map $H^{m}(M,\pi_{m-1}(V(k,n)))$.



chern classes(Own work)
What is a k-chern class? We want to understand the obstruction to finding k-linearly independant sections of a n-complex vector bundle E over a m-manifold M. Now, suppose we have a (k-1) linearly independant sections whose image is Y in E, and another section s: M $\to$ E. We want to find the transversal intersection of s and Y. So the preimage is s^{-1}(Y) whose codimension = (2n-2k+2) [by tranversality theorem : Guillemin Pollack pg 28).

Now,  the preimage might contain multiplicities, to compute that we follow a standard procedure : we take (2n-2k+2) ball 'orthogonal' to the preimage at a point p in the preimage. We take the (2n-2k+1) sphere, in  this we have a section s linearly independant to Y in E. So s takes image in a 2n-(2k-2) dimensional space(E/Y) = in a 2n-2k+1 sphere(after normalization). So the degree of this map s exactly represents the obstruction theory defn: i.e. it sends this 2n-2k+2 ball to the degree and hence is the n-k+1 Chern class.

Understanding : s is 0 at the centre , and non zero  on a sphere. By normalization , we get a map from sphere to sphere. If degree is 0, that means it can be extended to the whole ball and get a non zero value at the centre. This is how winding no. represents an obstruction)

From this it also follows that chern classes are poincare dual to the degeneracy locis

Chern Class(Curvature)
n-k+1 Chern Class represents how much the volume gets mapped = det(ds_{x}) 
Let k = n-1 so we compute 2-chern class=
det(4X4) matrix = 
det(A 0
    0 B) , by linear algebra : we arrange planes P1, P2 such that P1 gets mapped to P1, P2 gets mapped to P2 under s , hence 
  = det(c1 0
        0 c2) = c1 \wedge c2.
